<h1><a name="faq-donations"></a>A.9.7 How can I donate to PuTTY development?</h1>
<p>
Please, <em>please</em> don't feel you have to. PuTTY is completely free software, and not shareware. We think it's very important that <em>everybody</em> who wants to use PuTTY should be able to, whether they have any money or not; so the last thing we would want is for a PuTTY user to feel guilty because they haven't paid us any money. If you want to keep your money, please do keep it. We wouldn't dream of asking for any.
</p>
<p>
Having said all that, if you still really <em>want</em> to give us money, we won't argue :-) The easiest way for us to accept donations is if you send money to <code>&lt;anakin@pobox.com&gt;</code> using PayPal (<a href="http://www.paypal.com/"><code>www.paypal.com</code></a>). If you don't like PayPal, talk to us; we can probably arrange some alternative means.
</p>
<p>
Small donations (tens of dollars or tens of euros) will probably be spent on beer or curry, which helps motivate our volunteer team to continue doing this for the world. Larger donations will be spent on something that actually helps development, if we can find anything (perhaps new hardware, or a copy of Windows XP), but if we can't find anything then we'll just distribute the money among the developers. If you want to be sure your donation is going towards something worthwhile, ask us first. If you don't like these terms, feel perfectly free not to donate. We don't mind.
