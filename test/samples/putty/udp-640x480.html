<p>
There's a reason we have lots of tiny configuration panels instead of a few huge ones, and that reason is that not everyone has a 1600&#215;1200 desktop. 640&#215;480 is still a viable resolution for running Windows (and indeed it's still the default if you start up in safe mode), so it's still a resolution we care about.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, the PuTTY configuration box, and the PuTTYgen control window, are deliberately kept just small enough to fit comfortably on a 640&#215;480 display. If you're adding controls to either of these boxes and you find yourself wanting to increase the size of the whole box, <em>don't</em>. Split it into more panels instead.
