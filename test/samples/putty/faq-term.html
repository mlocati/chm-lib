<h1><a name="faq-term"></a>A.5.1 What <a name="i0"></a>terminal type does PuTTY use?</h1>
<p>
For most purposes, PuTTY can be considered to be an <code>xterm</code> terminal.
</p>
<p>
PuTTY also supports some terminal <a name="i1"></a>control sequences not supported by the real <code>xterm</code>: notably the Linux console sequences that reconfigure the colour palette, and the title bar control sequences used by <a name="i2"></a><code>DECterm</code> (which are different from the <code>xterm</code> ones; PuTTY supports both).
</p>
<p>
By default, PuTTY announces its terminal type to the server as <code>xterm</code>. If you have a problem with this, you can reconfigure it to say something else; <code>vt220</code> might help if you have trouble.
