If you've already tried all the relevant options in the PuTTY Keyboard panel, you may need to mail the PuTTY maintainers and ask.
</p>
<p>
It is <em>not</em> usually helpful just to tell us which application, which server operating system, and which key isn't working; in order to replicate the problem we would need to have a copy of every operating system, and every application, that anyone has ever complained about.
</p>
<p>
PuTTY responds to function key presses by sending a sequence of control characters to the server. If a function key isn't doing what you expect, it's likely that the character sequence your application is expecting to receive is not the same as the one PuTTY is sending. Therefore what we really need to know is <em>what</em> sequence the application is expecting.
</p>
<p>
The simplest way to investigate this is to find some other terminal environment, in which that function key <em>does</em> work; and then investigate what sequence the function key is sending in that situation. One reasonably easy way to do this on a <a name="i2"></a>Unix system is to type the command <a name="i3"></a><code>cat</code>, and then press the function key. This is likely to produce output of the form <code>^[[11~</code>. You can also do this in PuTTY, to find out what sequence the function key is producing in that. Then you can mail the PuTTY maintainers and tell us &#8216;I wanted the F1 key to send <code>^[[11~</code>, but instead it's sending <code>^[OP</code>, can this be done?&#8217;, or something similar.

You should still read the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/feedback.html">Feedback page</a> on the PuTTY website (also provided as <a href="feedback.html#feedback">appendix B</a> in the manual), and follow the guidelines contained in that.
