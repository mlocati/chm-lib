<h1><a name="faq-mailinglist1"></a>A.9.5 Why can't I subscribe to the putty-bugs mailing list?</h1>
<p>
Because you're not a member of the PuTTY core development team. The putty-bugs mailing list is not a general newsgroup-like discussion forum; it's a contact address for the core developers, and an <em>internal</em> mailing list for us to discuss things among ourselves. If we opened it up for everybody to subscribe to, it would turn into something more like a newsgroup and we would be completely overwhelmed by the volume of traffic. It's hard enough to keep up with the list as it is.
