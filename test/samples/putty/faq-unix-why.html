<h1><a name="faq-unix-why"></a>A.3.3 What's the point of the Unix port? Unix has OpenSSH.</h1>
<p>
All sorts of little things. <code>pterm</code> is directly useful to anyone who prefers PuTTY's terminal emulation to <code>xterm</code>'s, which at least some people do. Unix Plink has apparently found a niche among people who find the complexity of OpenSSL makes OpenSSH hard to install (and who don't mind Plink not having as many features). Some users want to generate a large number of SSH keys on Unix and then copy them all into PuTTY, and the Unix PuTTYgen should allow them to automate that conversion process.
</p>
<p>
There were development advantages as well; porting PuTTY to Unix was a valuable path-finding effort for other future ports, and also allowed us to use the excellent Linux tool <a href="http://valgrind.kde.org/">Valgrind</a> to help with debugging, which has already improved PuTTY's stability on <em>all</em> platforms.
</p>
<p>
However, if you're a Unix user and you can see no reason to switch from OpenSSH to PuTTY/Plink, then you're probably right. We don't expect our Unix port to be the right thing for everybody.
