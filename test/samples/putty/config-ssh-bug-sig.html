<h1><a name="config-ssh-bug-sig"></a>4.26.8 &#8216;Requires padding on SSH-2 <a name="i0"></a>RSA <a name="i1"></a>signatures&#8217;</h1>
<p>
Versions below 3.3 of <a name="i2"></a>OpenSSH require SSH-2 RSA signatures to be padded with zero bytes to the same length as the RSA key modulus. The SSH-2 specification says that an unpadded signature MUST be accepted, so this is a bug. A typical symptom of this problem is that PuTTY mysteriously fails RSA authentication once in every few hundred attempts, and falls back to passwords.
</p>
<p>
If this bug is detected, PuTTY will pad its signatures in the way OpenSSH expects. If this bug is enabled when talking to a correct server, it is likely that no damage will be done, since correct servers usually still accept padded signatures because they're used to talking to OpenSSH.
</p>
<p>
This is an SSH-2-specific bug.
