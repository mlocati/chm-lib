<p>
No, it doesn't. PuTTY just doesn't display the password you type, so that someone looking at your screen can't see what it is.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the Windows login prompts, PuTTY doesn't display the password as a row of asterisks either. This is so that someone looking at your screen can't even tell how <em>long</em> your password is, which might be valuable information.
