<h1><a name="errors-cannotassignaddress"></a>10.18 &#8216;Network error: Cannot assign requested address&#8217;</h1>
<p>
This means that the operating system rejected the parameters of the network connection PuTTY tried to make, usually without actually trying to connect to anything, because they were simply invalid.
</p>
<p>
A common way to provoke this error is to accidentally try to connect to port 0, which is not a valid port number.
