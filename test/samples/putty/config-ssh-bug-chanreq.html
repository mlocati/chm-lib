<h1><a name="config-ssh-bug-chanreq"></a>4.26.12 &#8216;Replies to requests on closed channels&#8217;</h1>
<p>
The SSH protocol as published in RFC 4254 has an ambiguity which arises if one side of a connection tries to close a channel, while the other side simultaneously sends a request within the channel and asks for a reply. RFC 4254 leaves it unclear whether the closing side should reply to the channel request after having announced its intention to close the channel.
</p>
<p>
Discussion on the <code>ietf-ssh</code> mailing list in April 2014 formed a clear consensus that the right answer is no. However, because of the ambiguity in the specification, some SSH servers have implemented the other policy; for example, <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1818">OpenSSH used to</a> until it was fixed.
</p>
<p>
Because PuTTY sends channel requests with the &#8216;want reply&#8217; flag throughout channels' lifetime (see <a href="config-ssh-bug-winadj.html#config-ssh-bug-winadj">section 4.26.5</a>), it's possible that when connecting to such a server it might receive a reply to a request after it thinks the channel has entirely closed, and terminate with an error along the lines of &#8216;Received <code>SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE</code> for nonexistent channel 256&#8217;.
