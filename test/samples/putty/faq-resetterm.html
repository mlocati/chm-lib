<h1><a name="faq-resetterm"></a>A.7.9 When I change some terminal settings, nothing happens.</h1>
<p>
Some of the terminal options (notably <a name="i0"></a>Auto Wrap and background-colour screen erase) actually represent the <em>default</em> setting, rather than the currently active setting. The server can send sequences that modify these options in mid-session, but when the terminal is reset (by server action, or by you choosing &#8216;Reset Terminal&#8217; from the System menu) the defaults are restored.
</p>
<p>
In versions 0.53b and prior, if you change one of these options in the middle of a session, you will find that the change does not immediately take effect. It will only take effect once you reset the terminal.
</p>
<p>
In version 0.54, the behaviour has changed - changes to these settings take effect immediately.
