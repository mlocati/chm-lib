<p>
This control allows you to specify what PuTTY should do if it tries to start writing to a log file and it finds the file already exists. You might want to automatically destroy the existing log file and start a new one with the same name. Alternatively, you might want to open the existing log file and add data to the <em>end</em> of it. Finally (the default option), you might not want to have any automatic behaviour, but to ask the user every time the problem comes up.
