<h1><a name="puttygen-load"></a>8.2.11 Reloading a private key</h1>
<p>
PuTTYgen allows you to load an existing private key file into memory. If you do this, you can then change the passphrase and comment before saving it again; you can also make extra copies of the public key.
</p>
<p>
To load an existing key, press the &#8216;Load&#8217; button. PuTTYgen will put up a dialog box where you can browse around the file system and find your key file. Once you select the file, PuTTYgen will ask you for a passphrase (if necessary) and will then display the key details in the same way as if it had just generated the key.
</p>
<p>
If you use the Load command to load a foreign key format, it will work, but you will see a message box warning you that the key you have loaded is not a PuTTY native key. See <a href="puttygen-conversions.html#puttygen-conversions">section 8.2.12</a> for information about importing foreign key formats.
