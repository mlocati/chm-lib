<h1><a name="faq-meaning"></a>A.10.3 What does &#8216;PuTTY&#8217; mean?</h1>
<p>
It's the name of a popular SSH and Telnet client. Any other meaning is in the eye of the beholder. It's been rumoured that &#8216;PuTTY&#8217; is the antonym of &#8216;<code>getty</code>&#8217;, or that it's the stuff that makes your Windows useful, or that it's a kind of plutonium Teletype. We couldn't possibly comment on such allegations.
