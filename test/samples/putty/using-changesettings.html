<p>
If you select <a name="i1"></a>&#8216;Change Settings&#8217; from the system menu, PuTTY will display a cut-down version of its initial configuration box. This allows you to adjust most properties of your current session. You can change the terminal size, the font, the actions of various keypresses, the colours, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Some of the options that are available in the main configuration box are not shown in the cut-down Change Settings box. These are usually options which don't make sense to change in the middle of a session (for example, you can't switch from SSH to Telnet in mid-session).
</p>
<p>
You can save the current settings to a saved session for future use from this dialog box. See <a href="config-saving.html#config-saving">section 4.1.2</a> for more on saved sessions.
