Various forms of this error are printed in the PuTTY window, or written to the PuTTY Event Log (see <a href="using-eventlog.html#using-eventlog">section 3.1.3.1</a>) during authentication.
</p>
<p>
If you see one of these messages, it means that the server has refused all the forms of authentication PuTTY has tried and it has no further ideas.
</p>
<p>
It may be worth checking the Event Log for diagnostic messages from the server giving more detail.
</p>
<p>
This error can be caused by buggy SSH-1 servers that fail to cope with the various strategies we use for camouflaging passwords in transit. Upgrade your server, or use the workarounds described in <a href="config-ssh-bug-ignore1.html#config-ssh-bug-ignore1">section 4.26.1</a> and possibly <a href="config-ssh-bug-plainpw1.html#config-ssh-bug-plainpw1">section 4.26.2</a>.
