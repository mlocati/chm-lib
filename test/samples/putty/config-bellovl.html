<h1><a name="config-bellovl"></a>4.5.3 &#8216;Control the <a name="i0"></a>bell overload behaviour&#8217;</h1>
<p>
A common user error in a terminal session is to accidentally run the Unix command <code>cat</code> (or equivalent) on an inappropriate file type, such as an executable, image file, or ZIP file. This produces a huge stream of non-text characters sent to the terminal, which typically includes a lot of bell characters. As a result of this the terminal often doesn't stop beeping for ten minutes, and everybody else in the office gets annoyed.
</p>
<p>
To try to avoid this behaviour, or any other cause of excessive beeping, PuTTY includes a bell overload management feature. In the default configuration, receiving more than five bell characters in a two-second period will cause the overload feature to activate. Once the overload feature is active, further bells will <a name="i1"></a> have no effect at all, so the rest of your binary file will be sent to the screen in silence. After a period of five seconds during which no further bells are received, the overload feature will turn itself off again and bells will be re-enabled.
</p>
<p>
If you want this feature completely disabled, you can turn it off using the checkbox &#8216;Bell is temporarily disabled when over-used&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if you like the bell overload feature but don't agree with the settings, you can configure the details: how many bells constitute an overload, how short a time period they have to arrive in to do so, and how much silent time is required before the overload feature will deactivate itself.
</p>
<p>
Bell overload mode is always deactivated by any keypress in the terminal. This means it can respond to large unexpected streams of data, but does not interfere with ordinary command-line activities that generate beeps (such as filename completion).
