<h1><a name="config-winborder"></a>4.8.4 Controlling the <a name="i0"></a>window border</h1>
<p>
PuTTY allows you to configure the appearance of the window border to some extent.
</p>
<p>
The checkbox marked &#8216;Sunken-edge border&#8217; changes the appearance of the window border to something more like a DOS box: the inside edge of the border is highlighted as if it sank down to meet the surface inside the window. This makes the border a little bit thicker as well. It's hard to describe well. Try it and see if you like it.
</p>
<p>
You can also configure a completely blank gap between the text in the window and the border, using the &#8216;Gap between text and window edge&#8217; control. By default this is set at one pixel. You can reduce it to zero, or increase it further.
