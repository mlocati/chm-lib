<p>
There isn't one, that we know of.

If someone else wants to set up a mailing list or other forum for PuTTY users to help each other with common problems, that would be fine with us, though the PuTTY team would almost certainly not have the time to read it. It's probably better to use one of the established newsgroups for this purpose (see <a href="feedback-other-fora.html#feedback-other-fora">section B.1.2</a>).
