<h1><a name="config-charclasses"></a>4.11.5 Configuring <a name="i0"></a>word-by-word selection</h1>
<p>
PuTTY will select a word at a time in the terminal window if you <a name="i1"></a>double-click to begin the drag. This panel allows you to control precisely what is considered to be a word.
</p>
<p>
Each character is given a <em>class</em>, which is a small number (typically 0, 1 or 2). PuTTY considers a single word to be any number of adjacent characters in the same class. So by modifying the assignment of characters to classes, you can modify the word-by-word selection behaviour.
</p>
<p>
In the default configuration, the <a name="i2"></a>character classes are:
</p>
<ul><li>
Class 0 contains <a name="i3"></a>white space and control characters.
</li>
<li>
Class 1 contains most <a name="i4"></a>punctuation.
</li>
<li>
Class 2 contains letters, numbers and a few pieces of punctuation (the double quote, minus sign, period, forward slash and underscore).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, for example, if you assign the <code>@</code> symbol into character class 2, you will be able to select an e-mail address with just a double click.
</p>
<p>
In order to adjust these assignments, you start by selecting a group of characters in the list box. Then enter a class number in the edit box below, and press the &#8216;Set&#8217; button.
</p>
<p>
This mechanism currently only covers ASCII characters, because it isn't feasible to expand the list to cover the whole of Unicode.
</p>
<p>
Character class definitions can be modified by <a name="i5"></a>control sequences sent by the server. This configuration option controls the <em>default</em> state, which will be restored when you reset the terminal (see <a href="reset-terminal.html#reset-terminal">section 3.1.3.6</a>). However, if you modify this option in mid-session using &#8216;Change Settings&#8217;, it will take effect immediately.
