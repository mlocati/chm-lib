<p>
All SSH-1 servers require your public key to be given to it in a one-line format before it will accept authentication with your private key. The <a name="i1"></a>OpenSSH server also requires this for SSH-2.
</p>
<p>
The &#8216;Public key for pasting into authorized_keys file&#8217; gives the public-key data in the correct one-line format. Typically you will want to select the entire contents of the box using the mouse, press Ctrl+C to copy it to the clipboard, and then paste the data into a PuTTY session which is already connected to the server.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="pubkey-gettingready.html#pubkey-gettingready">section 8.3</a> for general instructions on configuring public-key authentication once you have generated a key.
