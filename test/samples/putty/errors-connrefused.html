<h1><a name="errors-connrefused"></a>10.16 &#8216;Network error: Connection refused&#8217;</h1>
<p>
This error means that the network connection PuTTY tried to make to your server was rejected by the server. Usually this happens because the server does not provide the service which PuTTY is trying to access.
</p>
<p>
Check that you are connecting with the correct protocol (SSH, Telnet or Rlogin), and check that the port number is correct. If that fails, consult the administrator of your server.
