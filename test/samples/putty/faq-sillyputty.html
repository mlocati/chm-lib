<p>
You're looking at the wrong web site; the only PuTTY we know about here is the name of a computer program.

<p>
If you want the kind of putty you can buy as an executive toy, the PuTTY team can personally recommend Thinking Putty, which you can buy from Crazy Aaron's Putty World, at <a href="http://www.puttyworld.com"><code>www.puttyworld.com</code></a>.
