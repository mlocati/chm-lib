<p>
Some types of <a name="i1"></a>firewall, and almost any router doing Network Address Translation (<a name="i2"></a>NAT, also known as IP masquerading), will forget about a connection through them if the connection does nothing for too long. This will cause the connection to be rudely cut off when contact is resumed.
</p>
<p>
You can try to combat this by telling PuTTY to send <em>keepalives</em>: packets of data which have no effect on the actual session, but which reassure the router or firewall that the network connection is still active and worth remembering about.
</p>
<p>
Keepalives don't solve everything, unfortunately; although they cause greater robustness against this sort of router, they can also cause a <em>loss</em> of robustness against network dropouts. See <a href="config-keepalive.html#config-keepalive">section 4.13.1</a> in the documentation for more discussion of this.
