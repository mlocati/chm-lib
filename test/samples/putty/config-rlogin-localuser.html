<p>
Rlogin allows an automated (password-free) form of login by means of a file called <a name="i1"></a><code>.rhosts</code> on the server. You put a line in your <code>.rhosts</code> file saying something like <code>jbloggs@pc1.example.com</code>, and then when you make an Rlogin connection the client transmits the username of the user running the Rlogin client. The server checks the username and hostname against <code>.rhosts</code>, and if they match it <a name="i2"></a>does not ask for a password.
</p>
<p>
This only works because Unix systems contain a safeguard to stop a user from pretending to be another user in an Rlogin connection. Rlogin connections have to come from <a name="i3"></a>port numbers below 1024, and Unix systems prohibit this to unprivileged processes; so when the server sees a connection from a low-numbered port, it assumes the client end of the connection is held by a privileged (and therefore trusted) process, so it believes the claim of who the user is.
</p>
<p>
Windows does not have this restriction: <em>any</em> user can initiate an outgoing connection from a low-numbered port. Hence, the Rlogin <code>.rhosts</code> mechanism is completely useless for securely distinguishing several different users on a Windows machine. If you have a <code>.rhosts</code> entry pointing at a Windows PC, you should assume that <em>anyone</em> using that PC can <a name="i4"></a>spoof your username in an Rlogin connection and access your account on the server.
</p>
<p>
The &#8216;Local username&#8217; control allows you to specify what user name PuTTY should claim you have, in case it doesn't match your <a name="i5"></a>Windows user name (or in case you didn't bother to set up a Windows user name).
