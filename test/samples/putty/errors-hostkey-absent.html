<h1><a name="errors-hostkey-absent"></a>10.1 &#8216;The server's host key is not cached in the registry&#8217;</h1>
<p>
This error message occurs when PuTTY connects to a new SSH server. Every server identifies itself by means of a host key; once PuTTY knows the host key for a server, it will be able to detect if a malicious attacker redirects your connection to another machine.
</p>
<p>
If you see this message, it means that PuTTY has not seen this host key before, and has no way of knowing whether it is correct or not. You should attempt to verify the host key by other means, such as asking the machine's administrator.
</p>
<p>
If you see this message and you know that your installation of PuTTY <em>has</em> connected to the same server before, it may have been recently upgraded to SSH protocol version 2. SSH protocols 1 and 2 use separate host keys, so when you first use <a name="i0"></a>SSH-2 with a server you have only used SSH-1 with before, you will see this message again. You should verify the correctness of the key as before.
</p>

See <a href="gs-hostkey.html#gs-hostkey">section 2.2</a> for more information on host keys.
