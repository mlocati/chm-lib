<h1><a name="faq-win31"></a>A.3.5 Is there a port to <a name="i0"></a>Windows 3.1?</h1>
<p>
PuTTY is a 32-bit application from the ground up, so it won't run on Windows 3.1 as a native 16-bit program; and it would be <em>very</em> hard to port it to do so, because of Windows 3.1's vile memory allocation mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
However, it is possible in theory to compile the existing PuTTY source in such a way that it will run under <a name="i1"></a>Win32s (an extension to Windows 3.1 to let you run 32-bit programs). In order to do this you'll need the right kind of C compiler - modern versions of Visual C at least have stopped being backwards compatible to Win32s. Also, the last time we tried this it didn't work very well.
</p>
<p>
If you're interested in running PuTTY under Windows 3.1, help and testing in this area would be very welcome!
