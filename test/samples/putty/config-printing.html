<p>
A lot of VT100-compatible terminals support printing under control of the remote server. PuTTY supports this feature as well, but it is turned off by default.
</p>
<p>
To enable remote-controlled printing, choose a printer from the &#8216;Printer to send ANSI printer output to&#8217; drop-down list box. This should allow you to select from all the printers you have installed drivers for on your computer. Alternatively, you can type the network name of a networked printer (for example, <code>\\printserver\printer1</code>) even if you haven't already installed a driver for it on your own machine.
</p>
<p>
When the remote server attempts to print some data, PuTTY will send that data to the printer <em>raw</em> - without translating it, attempting to format it, or doing anything else to it. It is up to you to ensure your remote server knows what type of printer it is talking to.
</p>
<p>
Since PuTTY sends data to the printer raw, it cannot offer options such as portrait versus landscape, print quality, or paper tray selection. All these things would be done by your PC printer driver (which PuTTY bypasses); if you need them done, you will have to find a way to configure your remote server to do them.
</p>
<p>
To disable remote printing again, choose &#8216;None (printing disabled)&#8217; from the printer selection list. This is the default state.
