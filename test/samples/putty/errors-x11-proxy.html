<h1><a name="errors-x11-proxy"></a>10.13 &#8216;PuTTY X11 proxy: <em>various errors</em>&#8217;</h1>
<p>
This family of errors are reported when PuTTY is doing X forwarding. They are sent back to the X application running on the SSH server, which will usually report the error to the user.
</p>
<p>
When PuTTY enables X forwarding (see <a href="using-x-forwarding.html#using-x-forwarding">section 3.4</a>) it creates a virtual X display running on the SSH server. This display requires authentication to connect to it (this is how PuTTY prevents other users on your server machine from connecting through the PuTTY proxy to your real X display). PuTTY also sends the server the details it needs to enable clients to connect, and the server should put this mechanism in place automatically, so your X applications should just work.
</p>
<p>
A common reason why people see one of these messages is because they used SSH to log in as one user (let's say &#8216;fred&#8217;), and then used the Unix <code>su</code> command to become another user (typically &#8216;root&#8217;). The original user, &#8216;fred&#8217;, has access to the X authentication data provided by the SSH server, and can run X applications which are forwarded over the SSH connection. However, the second user (&#8216;root&#8217;) does not automatically have the authentication data passed on to it, so attempting to run an X application as that user often fails with this error.
</p>
<p>
If this happens, <em>it is not a problem with PuTTY</em>. You need to arrange for your X authentication data to be passed from the user you logged in as to the user you used <code>su</code> to become. How you do this depends on your particular system; in fact many modern versions of <code>su</code> do it automatically.
