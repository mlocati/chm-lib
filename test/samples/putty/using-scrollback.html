<p>
PuTTY keeps track of text that has scrolled up off the top of the terminal. So if something appears on the screen that you want to read, but it scrolls too fast and it's gone by the time you try to look for it, you can use the <a name="i1"></a>scrollbar on the right side of the window to look back up the session <a name="i2"></a>history and find it again.
</p>
<p>
As well as using the scrollbar, you can also page the scrollback up and down by pressing <a name="i3"></a>Shift-PgUp and <a name="i4"></a>Shift-PgDn. You can scroll a line at a time using <a name="i5"></a>Ctrl-PgUp and <a name="i6"></a>Ctrl-PgDn. These are still available if you configure the scrollbar to be invisible.
</p>
<p>
By default the last 2000 lines scrolled off the top are preserved for you to look at. You can increase (or decrease) this value using the configuration box; see <a href="config-scrollback.html#config-scrollback">section 4.7.3</a>.
