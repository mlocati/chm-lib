<p>
With local echo disabled, characters you type into the PuTTY window are not echoed in the window <em>by PuTTY</em>. They are simply sent to the server. (The <em>server</em> might choose to <a name="i1"></a>echo them back to you; this can't be controlled from the PuTTY control panel.)
</p>
<p>
Some types of session need local echo, and many do not. In its default mode, PuTTY will automatically attempt to deduce whether or not local echo is appropriate for the session you are working in. If you find it has made the wrong decision, you can use this configuration option to override its choice: you can force local echo to be turned on, or force it to be turned off, instead of relying on the automatic detection.
