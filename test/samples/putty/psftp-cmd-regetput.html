<h1><a name="psftp-cmd-regetput"></a>6.2.12 The <code>reget</code> and <code>reput</code> commands: <a name="i0"></a>resuming file transfers</h1>
<p>
If a file transfer fails half way through, and you end up with half the file stored on your disk, you can resume the file transfer using the <code>reget</code> and <code>reput</code> commands. These work exactly like the <code>get</code> and <code>put</code> commands, but they check for the presence of the half-written destination file and start transferring from where the last attempt left off.
</p>
<p>
The syntax of <code>reget</code> and <code>reput</code> is exactly the same as the syntax of <code>get</code> and <code>put</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>reget myfile.dat
reget myfile.dat newname.dat
reget -r mydir
</code></pre>
<p>
These commands are intended mainly for resuming interrupted transfers. They assume that the remote file or directory structure has not changed in any way; if there have been changes, you may end up with corrupted files. In particular, the <code>-r</code> option will not pick up changes to files or directories already transferred in full.
