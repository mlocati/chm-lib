<h1><a name="pageant-mainwin-addkey"></a>9.2.2 The &#8216;Add Key&#8217; button</h1>
<p>
To add a key to Pageant by reading it out of a local disk file, press the &#8216;Add Key&#8217; button in the Pageant main window, or alternatively right-click on the Pageant icon in the system tray and select &#8216;Add Key&#8217; from there.
</p>
<p>
Pageant will bring up a file dialog, labelled &#8216;Select Private Key File&#8217;. Find your private key file in this dialog, and press &#8216;Open&#8217;. If you want to add more than one key at once, you can select multiple files using Shift-click (to select several adjacent files) or Ctrl-click (to select non-adjacent files).
</p>
<p>
Pageant will now load the private key(s). If a key is protected by a passphrase, Pageant will ask you to type the passphrase.
</p>
<p>
(This is not the only way to add a private key to Pageant. You can also add one from a remote system by using agent forwarding; see <a href="pageant-forward.html#pageant-forward">section 9.4</a> for details.)
