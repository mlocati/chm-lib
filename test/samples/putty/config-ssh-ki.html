<p>
The SSH-2 equivalent of TIS authentication is called &#8216;keyboard-interactive&#8217;. It is a flexible authentication method using an arbitrary sequence of requests and responses; so it is not only useful for <a name="i1"></a>challenge/response mechanisms such as <a name="i2"></a>S/Key, but it can also be used for (for example) asking the user for a <a name="i3"></a>new password when the old one has expired.

<p>
PuTTY leaves this option enabled by default, but supplies a switch to turn it off in case you should have trouble with it.
