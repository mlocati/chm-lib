<h1><a name="errors-conntimedout"></a>10.17 &#8216;Network error: Connection timed out&#8217;</h1>
<p>
This error means that the network connection PuTTY tried to make to your server received no response at all from the server. Usually this happens because the server machine is completely isolated from the network, or because it is turned off.
</p>
<p>
Check that you have correctly entered the host name or IP address of your server machine. If that fails, consult the administrator of your server.
</p>
<p>
<a name="i0"></a>Unix also generates this error when it tries to send data down a connection and contact with the server has been completely lost during a connection. (There is a delay of minutes before Unix gives up on receiving a reply from the server.) This can occur if you type things into PuTTY while the network is down, but it can also occur if PuTTY decides of its own accord to send data: due to a repeat key exchange in SSH-2 (see <a href="config-ssh-kex-rekey.html#config-ssh-kex-rekey">section 4.19.2</a>) or due to keepalives (<a href="config-keepalive.html#config-keepalive">section 4.13.1</a>).
