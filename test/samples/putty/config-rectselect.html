<h1><a name="config-rectselect"></a>4.11.4 Default selection mode</h1>
<p>
As described in <a href="using-selection.html#using-selection">section 3.1.1</a>, PuTTY has two modes of selecting text to be copied to the clipboard. In the default mode (&#8216;Normal&#8217;), dragging the mouse from point A to point B selects to the end of the line containing A, all the lines in between, and from the very beginning of the line containing B. In the other mode (&#8216;Rectangular block&#8217;), dragging the mouse between two points defines a rectangle, and everything within that rectangle is copied.
</p>
<p>
Normally, you have to hold down Alt while dragging the mouse to select a rectangular block. Using the &#8216;Default selection mode&#8217; control, you can set <a name="i0"></a>rectangular selection as the default, and then you have to hold down Alt to get the <em>normal</em> behaviour.
