<h1><a name="faq-rekey"></a>A.7.23 My SSH-2 session <a name="i0"></a>locks up for a few seconds every so often.</h1>
<p>
Recent versions of PuTTY automatically initiate <a name="i1"></a>repeat key exchange once per hour, to improve session security. If your client or server machine is slow, you may experience this as a delay of anything up to thirty seconds or so.
</p>
<p>
These <a name="i2"></a>delays are inconvenient, but they are there for your protection. If they really cause you a problem, you can choose to turn off periodic rekeying using the &#8216;Kex&#8217; configuration panel (see <a href="config-ssh-kex.html#config-ssh-kex">section 4.19</a>), but be aware that you will be sacrificing security for this. (Falling back to SSH-1 would also remove the delays, but would lose a <em>lot</em> more security still. We do not recommend it.)
